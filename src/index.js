      <p>
        I'm a React Front-end developer. I started learning basic HTML in 4th grade and shifted my interest. I
        started studying web development when I started my bachelor's degree in 2015 at Business Computer.
        After I graduated with A Bachelor of Business Administration degree (BBA) in 2019 and get a job IT
        supporter a few months before the pandemic "Covid-19" at Thailand in 2019 I went deep dive into
        JavaScript and made a project by self-learning from documents and building a project. It was really
        fun. I have to tell myself "Never stop learning." and my goal is to become a full-stack developer
